# Expanded Damage (Ready Set Roll)
A simple Foundry VTT add-on for Ready Set Roll that expands damage dice rolls by default. They can still be collapsed manually.

## Why create this?
The 3.x.x version of D&D on Foundry made the decision to condense damage rolls into a single number. Which is fine...unless you're using an ability that has more than one damage type (such as initial damage on hit and then a DC check for possibly more damage). This can (and has) lead to confusion where abilities look like they do a lot more damage than they should. So I created this module to have the damage rolls automatically expanded by default, so the individual damage rolls can be seen.

## Why require Ready Set Roll?
The plain D&D chat boxes have no CSS classes or other indicators as to what type of roll is being done, so trying to expand the damage rolls would expand all rolls. Ready Set Roll adds the needed CSS classes though.
